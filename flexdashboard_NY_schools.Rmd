General County-level Metrics
=====================================  

### General County-level Metrics

```{r}

    filter(AGGREGATION_NAME == input$county)
  })

# **This renders
renderText({

# Value box for number of students in the county

    filter(AGGREGATION_NAME == input$county & SUBGROUP_NAME == "All Students")
})

renderValueBox({
  enrolled_students <- format(county_students()$ENROLL_CNT, big.mark = ",") 
  valueBox(caption = "Total Number of Enrolled Students", value = enrolled_students)

# Bar chart displaying graduation, dropout, still enrolled, and GED prep program rates by county as compared to NY state averages
# **This does not render

    geom_bar(stat = "identity",
             aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = AGGREGATION_NAME))

Gender-specific Metrics
=====================================  

### Gender-makeup

```{r}

# Filter by county

  df_gender %>%  
    filter(AGGREGATION_NAME %in% input$county) %>% 
    arrange(desc(SUBGROUP_NAME)) %>%

    theme_void() +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
    ggtitle("Gender Demographics")
})
```

### Graduation rate metrics by gender
```{r}
# Bar chart displaying requested metrics per county by gender
# **Need to change y-axis to a constant max value**
renderPlot({
  ggplot(data = gender_county()) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
